            Music sensation and global superstars BTS are ruling charts all over the world this summer with their
            back-to-back hits. Now, as their third English song ‘Permission to Dance’ won the internet for spreading joy
            amid Covid-19 pandemic, the K-Pop band launched a dance challenge.
            The peppy number — released on July 9 — saw the band dressed as edgy cowboys, dancing their hearts out with
            people from across the spectrum. Imagining a post-Covid world where masks no longer hide our smiles, the
            band deviated from their rigorous choreography, making way for easy moves so that everyone can join the fun.
            Taking a step further towards inclusivity, the band also included international sign language in their music
            video, in a nod to Disability Pride Month.
            Their latest English song, which is the second collaboration with popular singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran, has
            already topped the charts on Billboard Hot 100, with the baton being passed by group’s summer hit ‘Butter’.
            As the song urges all to dance amid such trying times, people around the world have joined the bandwagon.

        <h2>Lyrics</h2>
        <d1>
            It's the thought of being young
            When your heart's just like a drum
            Beating louder with no way to guard it
            When it all seems like it's wrong
            Just sing along to Elton John
            And to that feeling, we're just getting started
            <br>
            When the nights get colder
            And the rhythms got you falling behind
            Just dream about that moment
            When you look yourself right in the eye, eye, eye
            Then you say
            <br>
            I wanna dance, the music's got me going
            Ain't nothing that can stop how we move, yeah
            Let's break our plans and live just like we're golden
            And roll in like we're dancing fools
            <br>
            We don't need to worry
            'Cause when we fall, we know how to land
            Don't need to talk the talk, just walk the walk tonight
            'Cause we don't need permission to dance
            <br>
            There's always something that's standing in the way
            But if you don't let it faze ya, you'll know just how to break
            Just keep the right vibe, yeah, 'cause there's no looking back
            There ain't no one to prove, we don't got this on lock, yeah
            <br>
            The wait is over
            The time is now, so let's do it right
            Yeah, we'll keep going
            And stay up until we see the sunrise
            And we'll say
            <br>
            I wanna dance, the music's got me going
            Ain't nothing that can stop how we move, yeah
            Let's break our plans and live just like we're golden
            And roll in like we're dancing fools
            We don't need to worry
            <br>
            'Cause when we fall, we know how to land
            Don't need to talk the talk, just walk the walk tonight
            'Cause we don't need permission to dance
            <br>
            Da-na-na-na-na-na-na, da-na-na-na-na-na-na
            Da-na-na-na-na-na-na
            No, we don't need permission to dance
            Da-na-na-na-na-na-na, da-na-na-na-na-na-na
            Da-na-na-na-na-na-na
            <br>
            Well, let me show ya
            That we can keep the fire alive, mmm
            'Cause it's not over
            Till it's over, say it one more time, say
            <br>
            I wanna dance, the music's got me going (the music's got me going)
            Ain't nothing that can stop how we move, yeah (hey)
            Let's break our plans and live just like we're golden
            And roll in like we're dancing fools (like we're dancing fools)
            <br>
            We don't need to worry
            'Cause when we fall, we know how to land (we know how to land)
            Don't need to talk the talk, just walk the walk tonight
            'Cause we don't need permission to dance
